**D**ata **S**cience: **D**eep **L**earning **I**n **P**ython

My code from the Udemy course offered by LazyProgrammer. The original source code can be found at the
[location](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples) in the folders:
   ann_class
   ann_logistic_extra

This repository contains an annotated version of that code.
